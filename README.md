Example that shows how to consume notNet objects in PowerShell using a dll

The .Net framework is extremely extensive and being able to use the same framework across different platforms and languages can be very powerful.  I wrote this example to demonstrate two things.  The first was targeted at C# programmers and I was trying to highlight that PowerShell is a true object orientated language that consumes .Net objects natively.  The second was targeted at PowerShell scripters and I was trying to highlight the fact that precompiled objects written in a language such as C# are extremely efficient.

Often times we choose either one tool or the other instead of the best tool for the job.  C# and PowerShell are both tools and just like with any tool, it has advantages and disadvantages for using it.
